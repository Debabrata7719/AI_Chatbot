📚 Project Overview

MY-FIRST-AI-CHATBOT is a minimal yet powerful AI chatbot that demonstrates how to:

Integrate LangChain with Ollama

Handle contextual conversations

Run in both local Python environments and Docker containers

Package and distribute AI projects easily via Docker Hub

The project started as a small experiment with LangChain & Ollama but was later containerized so that anyone can run it instantly on their machine.

🐳 Run with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to use this project is with Docker.
No need to install Python or dependencies manually.

1. Pull the Docker Image
docker pull debabrata7/my-first-ai-agent:latest

2. Run the Container
docker run -it debabrata7/my-first-ai-agent:latest


That’s it! 🎉 The chatbot will run instantly inside Docker.

⚠️ Important: You must have Ollama
 running locally (ollama run llama3) because the chatbot depends on the Ollama model.
